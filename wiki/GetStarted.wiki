Since this plugin builds on top of [http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ jQueryUI's autocomplete] widget, pretty much all of autocomplete's options/events are applies to it as well, with the exception of `source`. GoogleSuggest for jQuery itself has 2 options: service and secure.

==Options:==
|| option || type || default || note ||
|| service || string || "" || It's used to specify what Google service to query against. It can be "youtube", "products", "books", "news", or "" (empty string). By default it queries Google's web auto sugggestions. ||
|| secure || boolean || false || It's used to specify whether to use HTTPS or not. By default it doesn't use secure connection. ||

Example: 
<code lang="javascript">
//uses default settings
$("#selector").googleSuggest(); 

//uses HTTPS
$("#selector").googleSuggest({secure: true});

//queries Google Products
$("#selector").googleSuggest({service: "products"});

//alerts the selected value
$("#selector").googleSuggestion({select: function(event, ui){ alert(ui.item.value); }});
